![](restaurant_ratings.png)
It consists of the highest rated restaurant which is Tortas Locas Hipocampo.
The average service rating, the average overall rating and the average food rating.
The preferred cuisine is Mexican.  
It has the sum of overall rating by name and cuisine which shows us that the highest rated restaurant does not serve Mexican dishes,  Instead they serve fast food.

### Consumer Demographic 
![](consumer_demo.png)
Shows us the count of consumers id which is 138
Consist of consumers demographics which include age_group, marital_status, occupation, transportation method, city, preferred cuisine.

## Conclusion and Recommendation
- The customers preference does not have an effect on the overall rating, because going through the preferred cuisine most of the customers preferred Mexican food but the highest rated restaurant serves fast food.
- The customer demographics does indicate a bias in the data sample because there are more single people amongst the customers which makes them opt out for fast food.

- The demand for Mexican food can be worked on by making the highest rated restaurant incorporate it along with what they serve

- Go for a restaurant with a high rating, The one easily accessible to the people, user friendly.
